Aim : To find largest element in array 


(Brute)
Approach 1 : Sorting the Array of size n in ascending order  and Returning the last index element. 
Time complexity: O(n*logn) 
Space Complexity: O(n)


(Better)
Approach 2 : Using a max variable initialized to index 0 of array and update the variable max to the index element if found greater than the initialized max  during the traversing in array. 
Time complexity: O(n) 
Space Complexity: O(1)
