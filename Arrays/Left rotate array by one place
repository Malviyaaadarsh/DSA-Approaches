Aim :  Given an array , we have to left rotate the array by one place (shifting the ith index element to i-1th index.)

(Brute)
Approach  :  Using a duplicate array of same size for storing the values in rotated manner. 
Shifting all values by 1 index , the 0th index to last index , and printing the array . 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) 

(Optimal)
Approach :  Declaring the 0th index a  variable (storing it in variable) , and iterating through the array i from [1,n-1] and 
assigning the i-1 th index element equal too i th index element .Then assigning the n-1 th index element the  element , atlast returning the array at last. 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
