Aim: To find union of two sorted arrays and return union array . 


Brute Force Approach : 

Using a Set to store elements of both the arrays ( why set ? , it will not take duplicate elements and for the union it make sense).We  after storing , 
will iterate the set and return it . 

Things about the set : It should not be unordered map 
The size of the set will be the size of our union array. (Let n)
If the number of array1 element are n1 and number of elements in array2 are n2 
Time Complexity : O(n1logn + n2logn) to O(n1+n2) 
Space Complexity : O(n1+n2) + O(n1+n2)    // for storing + for returning
