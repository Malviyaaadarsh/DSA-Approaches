Aim : To find the second largest element in array 


(Brute)
Approach 1 : Sorting the array of size n  in ascending order and returning the last second index. 
Edge Case 1 : Return -1 in case array consist of 0 elements or a single element . 
Edge Case 2 : Check whether Last and Second last or other element are equal. If No return second last , 
if yes return element from [n-2,0] the element not equal last element
Time Complexity : O(n*logn) in first case , O(n*logn + n) in second case
Space Complexity : O(1) 


(Better)
Approach 2 : Finding largest by first pass(taking largest as first index element and iterating array to see someone is larger than largest or not
, if found , will assign that the largest ) , then if there are all positive intergers in array taking second largest as -1 and INT_MIN for negative values 
, iterating through array and check if any element which is not equals to  largest , at the same time greater than seconsd largest . 
If we found then the element is second largest element in array.

Time Complexity : O(2n) for two passes
