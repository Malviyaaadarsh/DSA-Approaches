Aim : To find an element 'target' in sorted array


(brute)
Approach 1: By performing linear search (Traversing the array of size n , and checking for target) 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


Approach 2: (Iterative Implementation) By iterate through pointers at both ends (say low and high)  and checking the middle value ((high+low)/2) if
it is greater equal or lesser than 'target', and thereby trimming down the search space towards the space which contains target. 
Time Complexity: O(log n) 
Space Complexity: O(1) 


Approach 3: (Recursive Approach) Using the recursive functions to trim down the seach space in the above approach. 
Time Complexity: O(log n) 
Space Complexity: O(1)
