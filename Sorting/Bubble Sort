Bubble Sort is one of the most common sorting method used for sorting. 

Golden Rule : Pushes Maximum to Last index By Adjacent Swaps 
(Check if adjacent elements are sorted or not , if not swap it with adjacent element)


Approach : 
The Approach to implement Bubble Sort is - 

from [0,n-1] , swap adjacent if not sorted , till the largest element comes at last index i.e, [n-1] , fix the position of element at [1]
from [0,n-2] , swap adjacent if not sorted , till the largest element comes at last index i.e, [n-2] , fix the position of element at [1]
.
.
.
from [0,1] , swap adjacent if not sorted , till the largest element comes at last index i.e, [1] , fix the position of element at [1] , Array is sorted 


Implementation: 
For Example ,  for array of size n 
first we'll be running the outer loop i from last index n-1 to 1 and the inner loop  j from 0 to i-1 that 
will check the condition if any index j of array is greater than index j+1 of array , if found then it will                        
swap both indexes. 


Complexity Analysis : 
Time Complexity : O(n^2) for worst and average case , O(n) for best case (array is already sorted , so that we will break the loop)
Space Complexity : O(1)
