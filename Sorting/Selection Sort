Selection sort is one of the sorting techniques used for sorting.
with 
Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
Space Complexity: O(1)
Golden Rule - Select Minimum and Swap 



Approach : 
for Example ,  We've to sort array of n elements. Then, approach to implement Selection sort is : 

Swap at (index 0 and min element index) from [0,n-1] 
Swap at (index 1 and min element index) from [1,n-1] 
Swap at (index 2 and min element index) from [2,n-1] 
.
.
.
Swap at (index n-2 and min element index) from [n-2,n-1] 


This can be done by running an outer loop i from 0 to n-1 , which contain a minimum variable assigned to i ,
followed by inner loop j from 0 to n-1 which will check if any element is less than that on minimum index , if found , then assigned 
the minimum variable to j followed by swapping of minimum index element and i index element in outer loop .
